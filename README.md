# Goals and Objectives
In this repository, we're preparing for the Azure AI Engineer Associate exam. We'll cover building, managing, and deploying AI solutions using Azure AI services. Topics include using REST APIs and SDKs to build secure image processing, video processing, natural language processing, knowledge mining, and generative AI solutions on Azure. We'll also explore responsibilities like managing, monitoring, and securing Azure AI services. In this documentation, we will follow all the modules specified [here in the study guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/ai-102) and try to design or reproduce hands-on exercises. 

## Azure AI Vision
In this section we'll focus on Azure AI vision, a branch of AI in which a software interpret visual input, often in the form of images or videos.
